# SportProject
The sport FGCU club app will be accessed by everyone who is interested. The user will have the option to create an account. On top of that the user can become a member/fan of the club; meaning they can watch the games for free and have access to shop/food discounts by paying a small fee every month. The app will have a FGCU Club Shop section where they can buy merch directly from the school supply and be either shipped to us or picked up at campus. The Match Calendar will be in the homepage. It will be integraded with useful stats they can interact with like goals, assists, possession, shots on target, passses, etc. Social Media like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram and Tiktok will be linked in the Watch session. The user could also opt to see highltights in this Watch section via embeded videos from Youtube or Tiktok. Also, a news section will contain the latest news from the club and interviews from the players. Lastly, the user will have History Section where they can look at the trophy cabinet, past and present players and coaches, and matches that marked the history of the club.
