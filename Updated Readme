This project is focused on garnering fans and funds for FGCU Athletics. There is great potential to reach
people possibly interested in FGCU Athletics that are both inside FGCU and outside FGCU. One primary
problem to this is the lack of social media engagement and content. Nonetheless, one solution to this problem
is a phone app that uses Kotlin. Video APIs will be integrated to show highlights of games and star players
of various teams. Fans can get the latest updates on scores and statistics of teams and players. 
Futhermore, through advertising and using popular hashtags, social media can be utilized to reach all age 
demographics.
